This thesis has investigated the legal consequences of social media data collection with a certain focus on collection of tweets. The legal findings was then translated into possible enhancements of a tweet collecting software. The tweet collecting software was extended with a method for pseudonymization, however it turned out that our implementation had some serious performance issues.
