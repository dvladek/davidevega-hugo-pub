      <description>&lt;p&gt;Online communication is makes up a large part of the public discourse around current events, and increasingly has been the target for disinformation campaigns. Clearly, there is a need for some language-agnostic tool to map how the discourse shifts and evolves. As such, the goal of this analysis was to create a tool to collate posts from Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and Twitter into one dataset for comparison and analysis, then to generate weekly topics based off posts containing the term “NATO” from this dataset. In this way BERTopic was used in an attempt to divide posts relating to “NATO” into these topics and then map them week-by-week, creating connections between weeks based on the overall topic. This period ranged from the buildup of the Ukrainian/Russian conflict (1 November) until 2 June. The analysis covers four Nordic languages; Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish from the aforementioned platforms. The Swedish model proved unfruitful due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, however for the Danish, Finnish and Norwegian datasets, broad overall topics were generated as well as individual weekly topics for each of the broader topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Portrayal of the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine on Social Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyday communication consists of a complex of information, objective, and subjective. The meaning one tries to convey may hide certain attitudes, opinions, or even an attempt to influence the other, whether it is done knowingly or not. This can be achieved by analysing the content, such as its structure, grammar, and vocabulary. Social media as a form of communication is no exception to this fact. Discourse can be analysed by taking into account the underlying discursive production and interpret it in relation to this contextual understanding. Moreover, a vast amount of social media information exists online that could be analysed with that approach. For this reason, a tool was created to save online posts from the platforms of Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter into a large dataset, related to the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Then, using word2vec and tools on Python, the attitudes towards Russia, Ukraine, the invasion itself, and sanctions are analysed using Swedish, and to a lesser extent, Danish, Norwegian, and Finnish, with posts made from November of 2021 to March of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring How Swedish News are Framed Online</title>
      <link>https://davidevega.eu/education/projects/2022_newspapers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the project was to conduct a comparative study of how Swedish media - mainly online newspapers - might influence the public agenda by, knowingly or unknowingly, framing their news articles in a particular way. The project, therefore, aims at analyzing the language characteristics (e.g., topics, sentiments, polarization of ideas) of the news articles already collected from some of the most visited online newspapers and compare if there is a clear difference on how they choose to portrait some news, rather than others. This project was exploratory, a first step towards enabling data-driven research, and open, enabling students to pursue their own questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
