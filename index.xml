      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a co-taught with the other members of the InfoLab &lt;a href=&#34;https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N13-1077&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Matteo Magnani&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://user.it.uu.se/~chrohner/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Christian Rohner&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Network Science is a very active and interdisciplinary research area aimed at&#xA;studying physical, social and biological systems that can be modeled as sets of&#xA;interconnected entities. The course covers the basics of network science,&#xA;including social network analysis centrality measures (degree, betweenness, &amp;hellip;),&#xA;network properties (degree distribution, average path length, &amp;hellip;), network&#xA;models (Erdös-Renyi, small-world, preferential attachment), propagation&#xA;(SI/SIR/SIS models, &amp;hellip;), and the main network mining tasks (position/role&#xA;detection, link prediction, community detection). All topics will be introduced&#xA;in theory and practice, using the R system and different network analysis&#xA;packages as hands-on exercises during the lectures. Then, students choose and&#xA;review a set of important papers from different areas, selected by the teachers&#xA;based on their importance in the field, to learn about advanced applications and&#xA;developments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Social media are a key source of information for society, but it has been proven&#xA;that can be also an effective source of misinformation if the readers are not&#xA;critical or knowledgable enough. The goal of this project is to make a&#xA;randomized controlled experiment to test if and how much sustainability experts&#xA;can be manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first part of the project consists on exploring what type of platforms we&#xA;can use to run experiments like the one described below. Alternatively, if we&#xA;cannot find a viable platform, you will build a small web prototype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The power of mass media, such as TV shows, lies in their ability to influence&#xA;our cultural and political ideas through the lens of their characters or the&#xA;society they depict. In non-fictional dramas these representations can provide,&#xA;for the most part and with some limitations, an accurate account of how&#xA;a particular issue is perceived within a portion of the society. The goal of&#xA;this project is to study how gender is represented in western TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Immigrant-critical alternative media in online conversations</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/pubs/yantseva2023altright_css/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/pubs/yantseva2023altright_css/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we explore the role of immigrant-critical alternative media in shaping collective emotions and users’ evaluations of the immigration issue, using a conversational approach and an empirical case of Flashback, a prominent Swedish online platform where many immi- gration-related discussions take place. Our text and network-based analysis of more than 9,000 conversations during the last election period reveals that the platform users consume and distribute diverging types of media content across a wide ideological spectrum which, however, has a limited influence on the evolution of conversations and users’ stances in the immigration debate. Nevertheless, we find that the conversation networks with alternative media content tend to include more negative evaluations of the immigration issue, attracting fewer participants and lasting less than other conversations. We contextualise our findings using Collins’ Interaction Ritual Chains (IRC) theory and discuss the conditions under which such online conversations can produce high user involvement and, potentially, participants’ radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>User behavior influences structural properties of growing networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we study specific Reddit community, i.e., the /r/AmItheAsshole (AITA) subreddit1, from a temporal network perspective. In this subreddit people post stories about personal experience having ambiguous moral valence asking to other users if, in the narrated story, they have been ”assholes” ore not. This explicit judgement is performed by voting, i.e., writing a comment including a specific acronym corresponding to the judgement one want to express. The subreddit rules, moreover, specify that a brief motivation of the vote should be included in the comment. The explicit request for a judgement is therefore a requirement of this subreddit, which allows researchers to study how humans express moral judgements through sociolinguistic features. In short, we analyze each individual thread as an example of a dynamic process influenced by the behavior of the community, and try to answer the following question: is the structure of the network, and its evolution over time, reflecting different behaviors of the users participating in the conversation? Our analysis shows that the structure of the growing network is different from what the literature would suggest, since it is instead governed by two different processes caused by two different users behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human communication, either online or offline, is characterized by when information is shared from one actor to the other and by what specific information is exchanged. Using text as a way to represent the exchanged information, we can represent human communication systems with a temporal text network model where actors and messages coexist in a dynamic multilayer network. In this model, actors and messages are represented in separate layers, connected by inter-layer temporal edges representing the communication acts—who and when communicate what information. In this chapter we revisit some measures specifically developed for temporal networks, and extend them to the case of temporal text networks. In particular, we focus on defining measures relevant for the analysis of information propagation, including the concepts of walk, path, temporal precedence and path distance measures. We conclude by discussing how to use the proposed measures in practice by conducting a comparative analysis in a sample communication network based on Twitter mentions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Allure of Automated Machine Learning Services: How SMEs and non-expert users can benefit from AutoML frameworks</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/education/projects/2023_insurance-copy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study investigates how small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and other resource-lacking organisations can utilise automated machine learning (AutoML) to lessen the development hurdles associated with machine learning model development. This is achieved by comparing the performance, cost of usage, as well as usability and documentation for machine learning models developed through two AutoML frameworks: Vertex AI on Google Cloud™ and the open-source library AutoGluon, developed by Amazon Web Services. The study also presents a roadmap and a time plan that can be utilised by resource-lacking enterprises to guide the development of machine learning solutions implemented through AutoML frameworks. The results of the study show that AutoML frameworks are easy to use and capable in generating machine learning models. However, performance is not guaranteed and machine learning projects utilising AutoML frameworks still necessitates substantial development effort. Furthermore, the limiting factor in model performance is often training data quality which AutoML frameworks do not address.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explore the dynamics of conversations on Flashback, a Swedish online forum that has more than 1.5M registered users as of February 2023 and that claims to ensure freedom of speech and users’ anonymity. Specifically, we focus on the &amp;quot;Immigration and integration&amp;quot; [Integration och invandring] subforum, where a large part of immigration-related discussions takes place. Flashback’s case is especially interesting since previous research has demonstrated that biased and Islamophobic narratives are quite common on the platform (Kaati et al. 2022; Törnberg and Törnberg 2016). Using the dataset of 270k messages from the forum spanning the last election cycle in Sweden (2018-2022), we focus on the dissemination of links leading to right-wing alternative media as one of the potential drivers for the conversations on this subforum. In particular, our goal is to investigate the dissemination of such content on the subforum and to focus on the impact that such links (and, possibly, content in general) have on the dynamics of conversations and the users’ evaluations of the immigration issue in Sweden. Namely, using a combination of text and network analysis methods, we do the following: a) explore the differences in user stances and structure of the conversations depending on the dominant type of content shared, and b) study the evolution of users’ emotional states and subjective evaluations of the immigration issue on the macro-(forum) and meso- (conversation) levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This thesis investigates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from long and unstructured insurance policy documents. The goal is to reduce the amount of time required by readers to understand the coverage within the documents. The study uses predefined insurance policy coverage parameters, created by industry experts to represent what is covered in the policy documents. Three NLP approaches are used to classify the text sequences as insurance parameter classes. The thesis shows that using SBERT to create vector representations of text to allow cosine similarity calculations is an effective approach. The top scoring sequences for each parameter are assigned that parameter class. This approach shows a significant reduction in the number of sequences required to read by a user but misclassifies some positive examples. To improve the model, the parameter definitions and training data were combined into a support set. Similarity scores were calculated between all sequences and the support sets for each parameter using different pooling strategies. This few-shot classification approach performed well for the use case, improving the model’s performance significantly. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that NLP techniques can be applied to help understand unstructured insurance policy documents. The model developed in this study can be used to extract important information and reduce the time needed to understand the contents of aninsurance policy document. A human expert would however still be required to interpret the extracted text. The balance between the amount of relevant information and the amount of text shown would depend on how many of the top-scoring sequences are classified for each parameter. This study also identifies some limitations of the approach depending on available data. Overall, this research provides insight into the potential implications of NLP techniques for information extraction and the insurance industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is an area that many companies use in order to stay in line with technological development. To keep these systems productive and easily managed, a reference architecture can be used as a framework and also as a manual on how to structure an organization to suit its specific needs and goals. The reference architecture can make it easier to divide responsibility as well as working tasks within an organization. One company facing the challenges that comes with cloud based systems is Vattenfall, one of the biggest energy companies in Europe. An organization like Vattenfall handles a great load of customer data which is to be controlled and protected in every way. In order to keep on making sure that these systems are efficient and secure, a reference architecture could be a helpful tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Competitive chess is a sports category where players can freely participate in most of the competitions around the world without restriction - as opposed of other individual sports, where you must qualify in order to participate. In this project we were interested on exploring the mobility patterns of the players (e.g., how many play only national-level tournaments, what are the most visited countries/cities) across time and compare those with other competition factors (e.g., their own level, how strong is the national country of destination) in order evaluate how these inequalities can affect the ranking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Robustness and Sensitivity of Network-Based Topic Detection</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/pubs/galluccio022cna_txt/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the context of textual analysis, network-based procedures for topic detection are gaining attention as an alternative to classical topic models. Network-based procedures are based on the idea that documents can be represented as word co-occurrence networks, where topics are defined as groups of strongly connected words. Although many works have used network-based procedures for topic detection, there is a lack of systematic analysis of how different design choices, such as the building of the word co-occurrence matrix and the selection of the community detection algorithm, affect the final results in terms of detected topics. In this work, we present the results obtained by analysing a widely used corpus of news articles, showing how and to what extent the choices made during the design phase affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tracking the Conversation around NATO in the Nordic States Using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Online communication is makes up a large part of the public discourse around current events, and increasingly has been the target for disinformation campaigns. Clearly, there is a need for some language-agnostic tool to map how the discourse shifts and evolves. As such, the goal of this analysis was to create a tool to collate posts from Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and Twitter into one dataset for comparison and analysis, then to generate weekly topics based off posts containing the term “NATO” from this dataset. In this way BERTopic was used in an attempt to divide posts relating to “NATO” into these topics and then map them week-by-week, creating connections between weeks based on the overall topic. This period ranged from the buildup of the Ukrainian/Russian conflict (1 November) until 2 June. The analysis covers four Nordic languages; Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish from the aforementioned platforms. The Swedish model proved unfruitful due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, however for the Danish, Finnish and Norwegian datasets, broad overall topics were generated as well as individual weekly topics for each of the broader topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Portrayal of the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine on Social Media</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/education/projects/2022_invasion/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyday communication consists of a complex of information, objective, and subjective. The meaning one tries to convey may hide certain attitudes, opinions, or even an attempt to influence the other, whether it is done knowingly or not. This can be achieved by analysing the content, such as its structure, grammar, and vocabulary. Social media as a form of communication is no exception to this fact. Discourse can be analysed by taking into account the underlying discursive production and interpret it in relation to this contextual understanding. Moreover, a vast amount of social media information exists online that could be analysed with that approach. For this reason, a tool was created to save online posts from the platforms of Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter into a large dataset, related to the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Then, using word2vec and tools on Python, the attitudes towards Russia, Ukraine, the invasion itself, and sanctions are analysed using Swedish, and to a lesser extent, Danish, Norwegian, and Finnish, with posts made from November of 2021 to March of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the project was to conduct a comparative study of how Swedish media - mainly online newspapers - might influence the public agenda by, knowingly or unknowingly, framing their news articles in a particular way. The project, therefore, aims at analyzing the language characteristics (e.g., topics, sentiments, polarization of ideas) of the news articles already collected from some of the most visited online newspapers and compare if there is a clear difference on how they choose to portrait some news, rather than others. This project was exploratory, a first step towards enabling data-driven research, and open, enabling students to pursue their own questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A huge variety of social applications, such as Twitter and Instagram, have been developed over the last few decades. With the introduction of these online social networks, there has never been a better time to research human interaction on a worldwide scale. The goal of this project is to use a scalable and high-performance Twitter data visualization platform to investigate Twitter data on a given topic in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To create a scalable Twitter data visualization platform, we write a basic version of the system using the Twitter Developer Platform&amp;rsquo;s real-time and non-real-time APIs, optimize the frontend and backend performance with various components, and devise a benchmarking testing scheme to see if the application meets the scalability and high-performance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human-generated information underlies nearly every aspect of our lives. With the rise of affordable handheld and embedded IoT devices with new connectivity capabilities and the ever-increasing integration of many technologies with social media platforms, most social problem-solving processes are increasingly relying on online conversations and textual communication. However, unlike in a face-to-face situation, where we can fairly recognise which conversations are co-occurring around us and their participants, automatically identifying cohesive conversations online is a challenging task. The aim of this talk is to discuss how we can combine network-analytic methodologies with textual data to better infer conversational structures in social media. Rather than providing direct answers to this problem, we would like instead to use this opportunity to report our current strategies and efforts to disentangle multiple intertwined conversations around similar topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multiplex social networks are characterized by a common set of actors connected through multiple types of relations. The multinet package provides a set of R functions to analyze multiplex social networks within the more general framework of multilayer networks, where each type of relation is represented as a layer in the network. The package contains functions to import/export, create and manipulate multilayer networks, implementations of several state-of-the-art multiplex network analysis algorithms, e.g., for centrality measures, layer comparison, community detection and visualization. Internally, the package is mainly written in native C++ and integrated with R using the Rcpp package.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software development is an area in which companies not only need to keep up with the latest technology, but they additionally need to continuously increase their productivity to stay competitive in the industry. One company currently facing these challenges is Storytel - one of the strongest players on the Swedish audiobook market - with about a fourth of all employees involved with software development, and a rapidly growing workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the purpose of understanding how the Storytel Tech Department is performing, this thesis maps Storytel’s productivity defined through the Four Key Metrics - Deployment Frequency, Delivery Lead Time, Mean Time To Restore and Change Fail Rate. A classification is made into which performance category (Low, Medium, High, Elite) the Storytel Tech Department belongs to through a deep-dive into the raw system data existing at Storytel, mainly focusing on the case management system Jira. A survey of the Tech Department was conducted, to give insights into the connection between human and technical factors influencing productivity (categorized into Culture, Environment, and Process) and estimated productivity. Along with these data collections, interviews with Storytel employees were performed to gather further knowledge about the Tech Department, and to understand potential bottlenecks and obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Swedish Newspapers Using Topic Detection and Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Newspapers might report on the same event, say a sport event or a political statement, but since they most likely differ in the presentation, are the content and under laying message of the articles actually the same? A human can read two separate articles and determine if they touch similar subjects and if they approach the subject in a positive or negative way. If this comparison would be preformed over several thousand of articles a computer would very much be the preferred method. However, a computer needs to be trained to understand the topics of the articles to be able to detect the topics and make the comparison.The two goals of this project is to find and identify topics within articles extracted from Swedish newspapers as well as preforming sentiment analysis on the most similar topic pairs.This project presents a Python 3 implementation of extracting textual data from Swedish newspapers, identify and assign topics to those articles, as well as preform sentiment analysis on articles based on their topics and day of publication. To extract the text from each article web scraping was used. The topic detection was performed with the help of non-negativefactorisation matrices. To determine each article polarity andemotional state TextBlob was utilised. Both goals were accomplished. The method used to extract textualdata was successful and topics for each article was successfullyidentified. The topic detection and sentiment analysis proved to be mostly correct while manually inspecting the most similar article pairs between the newspapers. The results was presented with dumbbell plots for the most similar article pairs. These plots shows each pairs polarity and subjectivity score and was therefore used to manually analyse the actual similarity between these articles as well as to their sentimentic structure. However, the results are deemed to be too unreliable to draw any significant conclusion in the sentiment difference and likeliness between the newspapers. This is because of the absence of a proper implementation of Swedish part-to-speech tags and lemmatization, which was noticed too late into the development process to be able to correct. These changes are however discussed and reflected upon in the purpose to gain insight in how the implemented solution could have been improved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stochastic block models (SBM) are generative models for network structures such as communities, sets of nodes characterized by being more densely connected with one another than with the rest of the network. One of the main advantages of generative models, such as SBM, is that they open the door to inference: if we are given a network G, we can use techniques from statistical inference to estimate the values of θ that best explain or reproduce the observed pattern of connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present a methodology integrating social media data, data from qualitative research and network analysis. Qualitative insights gained from ethnographic fieldwork are used to collect and annotate social network data, and social media data is used as part of the ethnography to identify relevant actors and topics. The methodology is presented in the context of an analysis of the Internet of Things in the European context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multilayer networks have been widely used to represent and analyze systems of interconnected entities where both the entities and their connections can be of different types. However, real multilayer networks can be difficult to analyze because of irrelevant information, such as layers not related to the objective of the analysis, because of their size, or because traditional methods defined to analyze simple networks do not have a straightforward extension able to handle multiple layers. Therefore, a number of methods have been devised in the literature to simplify multilayer networks with the objective of improving our ability to analyze them. In this article we provide a unified and practical taxonomy of existing simplification approaches, and we identify categories of multilayer network simplification methods that are still underdeveloped, as well as emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of 2018 there is a new regulation regarding data protection in the European union. The legislation, often refereed to as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), has led to increased demands on organizations that processes personal data. This thesis has investigated the legal consequences of social media data collection with a certain focus on collection of tweets. The legal findings was then translated into possible enhancements of a tweet collecting software. The tweet collecting software was extended with a method for pseudonymization, however it turned out that our implementation had some serious performance issues. There where also work done on an implementation of a method providing automatic tweet posting with the purpose to repeatedly inform followers of a hashtag that a collection of tweets regarding that hashtag is taking place. Lastly, some findings about possible future enhancements that can be done on the software was laid out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In text mining, texts are usually transformed into numerical vectors or feature vectors, before they are given to a machine learning algorithm for text classification. In this project, a set of features for classifying tweets in Swedish was created. The following classification tasks were selected: gender, age and political party prediction, sentiment analysis and authorship attribution, which is the task of determining if a text was written by a particular author or not. Relevant previous studies were researched and a suitable subset of features used in those studies were chosen. A tool was developed that preprocesses the tweets and calculates, for each tweet, values for the features in the feature set. Experiments were run on a data set consisting of tweets written by Swedish politicians. The output of the tool was given to a machine learning algorithm that created classification models. While the first four classification tasks were unsuccessful, some of the authorship attribution models managed to produce an F-score between 80 and 90%. For the failed classification tasks, the features need to be tested on a different data set or new features have to be created.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Metrics for Temporal Text Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human communication, either online or offline, is characterized by when information is shared from one actor to the other and by what specific information is exchanged. Using text as a way to represent the exchanged information, we can represent human communication systems with a temporal text network model where actors and messages coexist in a dynamic multilayer network. In this model, actors and messages are represented in separate layers, connected by inter-layer temporal edges representing the communication acts—who and when communicate what information. In this chapter we revisit some measures specifically developed for temporal networks, and extend them to the case of temporal text networks. In particular, we focus on defining measures relevant for the analysis of information propagation, including the concepts of walk, path, temporal precedence and path distance measures. We conclude by discussing how to use the proposed measures in practice by conducting a comparative analysis in a sample communication network based on Twitter mentions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes to use MeetUp data to study the emergence and the evolution of the technological trend commonly known as Internet of Things (IoT). Starting from a manually selected sample of 220 European MeetUp groups we used MeetUp&#39;s APIs, to retrieve additional information about the events and participating users. The final dataset consists of 220 groups, 32967 members and 2386 events from 2011 until now (Jan 2019). The results suggest the presence of clearly identifiable European hubs for IoT development but a worldwide crowd of users. From a temporal perspective the MeetUp data shows how IoT exploded in 2015 and how it might have peaked in 2017. Within this period of time IoT has not been a &lt;code&gt;stable technology&amp;amp;#x27;&amp;amp;#x27; but as evolved incorporating, within its area of &lt;/code&gt;related topics&#39;&#39; new and emerging technologies such as Cryptocurrency or cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pattern Detection in Bipartite Temporal Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pattern detection in social networks has been of great interest recently because it helps to reveal insights about how people communicate. In graph mining, this is referred to as a frequent sub-graphs mining problem and it has many variations regarding the structure of the network - i.e. how much information the graph holds. As a part of the evolution of the problem, additional information such as data dimensions or more advanced network structure are incorporated to the input to find more interesting hidden patterns. This thesis concerns finding patterns in Twitter data modeled as a bipartite network with an additional temporal dimension. After defining three topology-based types of pattern mathematically, three pattern detection methods are developed, implemented and tested on real-world data collected from Twitter. The results reveal the most popular patterns of each type on Twitter data, a decaying tendency in the replying time as the conversation develops and other interesting observations. They also show that using the difference between two consecutive messages in a pattern (time leap) could be a good alternative time constraint for a time window in pattern detection. Despite being run on a small number of test cases, the results successfully demonstrate the potential of studying chain-like patterns separated from the dominant star-like ones in social networks like Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The widespread social media usage generates an immense amount of data. Data which is highly beneficial to several domains whether monetary or research based. Various models exist to extract this data however analysis tend to be restrictive. The temporal text network model is a dynamic network model built upon the foundation of temporal networks. It provides text as a variable and considers messages passed between users while maintaining the time of transmission, making it suitable for social media analysis. No measures exist to perform this analysis, the objective of this thesis was therefore to develop measures to be used in the mapping of communicative behaviour on two Twitter datasets. The created measures conclude that communication is similar on Twitter no matter the domain observed. When further reducing the scope of a political dataset, information regarding the social media presence between parties and the localization of key questions was found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From interaction to participation: the role of the imagined audience in social media community detection and an application to political communication on Twitter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the context of community detection in online social media, a lot of effort has been put into the definition of sophisticated network clustering algorithms and much less on the equally crucial process of obtaining high-quality input data. User-interaction data explicitly provided by social media platforms has largely been used as the main source of data because of its easy accessibility. However, this data does not capture a fundamental and much more frequent type of participatory behavior where users do not explicitly mention others but direct their messages to an invisible audience following a common hashtag. In the context of multiplex community detection, we show how to construct an additional data layer about user participation not relying on explicit interactions between users, and how this layer can be used to find different types of communities in the context of Twitter political communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three fundamental elements to understand human information networks are the individuals (actors) in the network, the information they exchange, that is often observable online as text content (emails, social media posts, etc.), and the time when these exchanges happen. An extremely large amount of research has addressed some of these aspects either in isolation or as combinations of two of them. There are also more and more works studying systems where all three elements are present, but typically using ad hoc models and algorithms that cannot be easily transferred to other contexts. To address this heterogeneity, in this article we present a simple, expressive and extensible model for temporal text networks, that we claim can be used as a common ground across different types of networks and analysis tasks, and we show how simple procedures to produce views of the model allow the direct application of analysis methods already developed in other domains, from traditional data mining to multilayer network mining.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years online social media have been frequently used as a way to explain human social behavior around a particular area of interest. Examples include voting, political sentiment, psychological well-being and disaster response. The public accessibility of several sources allows us to observe these phenomena at various scales, from conversations among small groups of individuals to the effects on large communities. To cope with the complexity of online information, researchers have typically focused on either the topology of the interactions, as commonly done in Network Science, or the text exchanged among individuals, using methods from Computational Linguistics. In both cases time has also been taken into consideration, as in Temporal Networks or Temporal Information Retrieval. Fewer recent studies have begun to combine methods from multiple fields to exploit the richness of the sources, leading to new fundamental methodologies for analyzing online complex information. However, their validity and scope are mostly limited to answer specific questions, preventing such new methods to be applied to other domains. As a result, nearly every new problem in this context requires the development of its own ad-hoc models and/or methods. In this work, we introduce an attributed bipartite model for temporal text networks, enabling the application of a wide range of existing methods to this context. Our model can represent all the information contained in the aforementioned data sources, including different types of text interactions, such as direct messages exchanged between individuals, multicast information targeting specific communities or broadcast news. The aim of this talk is to provide a flexible framework to analyze text networks while exploiting all the available data. To achieve this, we will first present a comparative analysis of several models for text networks, showing how all previous models can be reduced to our minimal model. This will lead to a discussion about what we can/need to capture to analyze such type of data. Then, we will introduce one of the many approaches to analyze text networks based on information discretization. In this approach text messages can be classified into a number of (possibly overlapping) groups, based on their attributes. This classification can be exploited by projecting the original information into several derived types of networks, such as communication networks, user-annotated networks, topic-based multiplex networks and information propagation networks for which existing analysis methods exist. As a running example, we use the aforementioned model and methodology to investigate the existence of strong and deep communities of individuals discussing about several topics around the IoT space in a corpus of more than 200,000 tweets collected during June, 2017. Using different types of projections, or working directly with the original model, several types of text and structural analysis can be unified under the same framework. Examples include conversation retrieval and text message clustering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A large amount of human generated information is available online in the form of text exchanged between individuals or groups. Examples include social network sites, on- line forums and emails. The public accessibility of several of these sources allows us to observe our society at various scales, from conversations among small groups of individuals to the effects of misinformation on large communities. To cope with the complexity of online information, researchers have typically focused on either the topology of the network, as commonly done in Network Science, or the text exchanged among individuals, using methods from Computational Linguistics. In both cases time has also been taken into consideration, as in Temporal Networks or Temporal Information Retrieval. In this work, we introduce an attributed multilayer model for temporal text net- works, enabling the application of a wide range of existing methods to this context. Our model can represent all the information contained in the aforementioned data sources, including different types of text interactions, such as direct messages exchanged be- tween individuals, multicast information targeting specific communities or broadcast news.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The content of Online Illicit Marketplaces (OIMs) on the Dark Web has been studied using different approaches. For example, qualitative ethnographic studies to understand the markets&#39; social dynamics have produced interesting descriptions of specific sites, contexts and behaviours [1]; but given the large amount of data exchanged on several markets a manual qualitative analysis can only provide a partial view of these systems. Therefore, more quantitative approaches have been used (e.g., to provide an overview of the exchanges and social dynamic within the Silk Road OIM [2]), and to classify the information exchanged online (e.g., clustering forum posts depending on the function of the post or the type of drug [3]). These quantitative methods can scale to larger datasets, but they cannot extract the rich behavioural information that can be obtained through manual inspection of the data. In this poster we show our experience combining both, statistical inference methods and blockmoldeing techniques approaches, into a single analysis pipeline able to provide a more complete understanding of the social dynamics occurring on these types of online participatory forums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards Network-Aware Service Placement in Community Network Micro-Clouds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud services in community networks have been enabled by micro-cloud providers. They form community network micro-clouds (CNMCs), which grow organically, i.e. without being planned and optimized beforehand. Services running in community networks face specific challenges intrinsic to these infrastructures, such as the limited capacity of nodes and links, their dynamics and geographic distribution. CNMCs are used to deploy distributed applications, such as streaming and storage services, which transfer significant amounts of data between the nodes on which they run. Currently there is no support given to users for enabling them to chose better or the best option for specific service deployments. This paper looks at the next step in community network cloud service deployments, by taking network characteristics into account when deciding placement of service instances. We propose a service placement algorithm (PASP) that minimizes the service overlay diameter, while fulfilling service specific criteria. First, we characterize with simulations the potential performance gains of our approach. Secondly, we apply our algorithm to deploy a distributed storage service currently used in Guifi.net, and evaluate it in the real production network, assessing the performance and effects of our algorithm. We find that our PASP algorithm reduces the client reading times by an average of 16 % (with a max. improvement of 31 %) compared to the currently used organic placement scheme. Our results show how the choice of an appropriate set of nodes, taken from a larger resource pool, can influence service performance significantly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We rethink and extend the concepts of position and role in a network, basing them on various well-known measures that were not previously associated with these concepts, such as geodesic distance and modularity. The effectiveness of our new role and position detection algorithms is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, on synthetic and real data, showing that we can identify new types of meaningful patterns in networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collaborative learning activities have shown to be useful to address educational processes in several contexts. Monitoring these activities is mandatory to determine the quality of the collaboration and learning processes. Recent research works propose using Social Network Analysis techniques to understand students’ collaboration learning process during these experiences. Aligned with that, this paper proposes the use of the indirect blockmodeling network analytic technique for monitoring the behaviour of different social roles played by students in collaborative learning scenarios. The usefulness of this technique was evaluated through a study that analysed the students’ interaction network in a collaborative learning activity. Particularly, we tried to understand the structure of the interaction network during that process. Preliminary results suggest that indirect blockmodeling is highly useful for inferring and analysing the students’ social roles, when the behaviour of roles are clearly different among them. This technique can be used as a monitoring service that can be embedded in collaborative learning applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Incentives for sharing heterogeneous resources in distributed systems: a participatory approach</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contributory and volunteer computing ecosystems built around a community of participants need, like any other common-pool resources, an adaptive governance mechanism to guarantee the sustainability of the ecosystem. Reciprocity incentive mechanisms based on economic principles have been proved efficient solutions to regulate the resource sharing and allocation in large computing architectures, guaranteeing a direct retribution for each individual contribution even in presence of misbehaving users. However, while these mechanisms preserve the macro-equilibrium of the computational shared resources (e.g., CPU or memory), participants with fewer resources face problems competing for the attention of other members with more resources to cooperate with; making it difficult to apply such principles in practice. Additionally, active members of the community contributing in other aspects (e.g., doing administrative tasks or developing software) are not con- templated in traditional schemes although their time and effort are also part of the common-pool resource and hence, should be retributed somehow. The aim of this thesis is to revisit some of the architectural aspects of current systems and propose a framework to govern contributory and volunteer computing ecosystems in a fairer way based on principles of participatory economics. Our main contributions in this thesis are threefold. First, we examine the mechanisms ruling the resource sharing and propose a new reciprocal incentive mechanism that measures participants’ effort on sharing resources instead of their direct contribution, so it increases the collaboration opportunities of users with fewer resources in heterogeneous scenarios. Second, we propose a regulation mechanism for allocating new computational devices and distribute new resources within them, with the objective of increasing their impact in the common-pool resources when the demand of re- sources is supplied by the community. Third, we propose new methods to detect and analyze the social positions and roles of the community members, enabling the governance mechanism to be adapted taking into account members’ effort on several tasks not considered otherwise. The main contributions of this thesis conform a single framework that has been tested experimentally, using simulations, in a resource-sharing environment with non-strategic participants. Potentially, the mechanisms developed in this thesis will open new opportunities to apply political-economic and social ideas to the new generation of volunteer, contributory or grid computing systems; as well as other common-pool resources scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Time Series Analysis to Predict Link Quality of Wireless Community Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Community networks have emerged under the mottos “break the strings that are limiting you”, “don&#39;t buy the network, be the network” or “a free net for everyone is possible”. Such networks create a measurable social impact as they provide to the community the right and opportunity of communication. As any other network that mixes wired and wireless links, the routing protocol must face several challenges that arise from the unreliable nature of the wireless medium. Link quality tracking helps the routing layer to select links that maximize the delivery rate and minimize traffic congestion. Moreover, link quality prediction has proved to be a technique that surpasses link quality tracking by foreseeing which links are more likely to change its quality. In this work, we focus on link quality prediction by means of a time series analysis. We apply this prediction technique in the routing layer of large-scale, distributed, and decentralized networks. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict the link quality in 98% of the instances, both in the short and the long terms. Particularly, we analyse the behaviour of the links globally to identify the best prediction algorithm and metric, the impact of lag windows in the results, the prediction accuracy some time steps ahead into the future, the degradation of prediction over time, and the correlation of prediction with topological features. Moreover, we also analyse the behaviour of links individually to identify the variability of link quality prediction between links, and the variability of link quality prediction over time. Finally, we also present an optimized prediction method that considers the knowledge about the expected link quality values.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Technological Overview of the Guifi.net Community Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This work presents a technological analysis of guifi.net, a free, neutral, and open-access community network. Guifi.net consists of more than 27,000 operational nodes, which makes it the world’s largest community network in terms of the number of nodes and coverage area. This paper describes the characteristics of the network, the link level topology, its growth over a decade, and its resilience in terms of availability and reachability of network nodes. Our study is based on open data published by guifi.net regarding its nodes and wireless links, monitoring information, community database, and its web portal. The data includes historical information that covers the lifetime of the network. The scale and diversity of the network requires a separate analysis of the subsets of the entire dataset by area or by separating the core from the leaf nodes. This shows some degree of diversity in local characteristics caused by several demographic, geographic, technological, and network design factors. We focus on the following aspects: technological network diversity, topology characteristics, evolution of the network over time, analysis of robustness, and its effect on networking service availability. In addition, we analyse how the community, the technology used, the geographical region where the network is deployed, and its self-organised structure shape the network properties and determine its strengths and weaknesses. The study demonstrates that the guifi.net community network is diverse in technological choices for hardware, link protocols, and channels and uses a combination of routing protocols yet provides a common private IP network. The graph topology follows a power-law distribution for links in regions up to a few thousand km^2 limited to the scope of wireless links. Network growth has two aspects: a geographic growth of the network core using long distance links with wireless or fibre, and the local growth in density with leaf low-cost leaf nodes. The resilience of the network derived from the nodes’ uptime and the structure of the graph varies across different regions with more fragile leafs than core nodes and diverse degrees of graph resilience to random failures or coordinated attacks, such as natural causes, depending on the network planning, structure, and maturity. The guifi.net community network results from a loosely coupled and decentralised organic growth that exhibits large local differences, diverse growth, and maturity under a common community license and social network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Role and position detection in networks: reloaded</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Roles and positions are structural components in complex social systems which group actors based on how similarly they are connected to the rest of the actors. Role and position detection methods have been successfully used to evaluate and understand the dynamics of social networks and the behavior of their members. However, actor similarities used to detect positions have been based on pairwise comparisons so far: e.g., structural equivalence states that Alice and Bob are in the same position if they are both connected or not to the same other actors in the network, one by one. In this work we present a new framework to find positions and roles using comparisons between actors and sets of actors instead of just using pairwise comparisons. In this way we enable the usage of many more measures of similarity inside position and role detection methods, e.g., based on distances, community structure, triangles and cliques. As a result, we can identify new types of easily interpretable positions. Additionally, the proposed idea can be adapted to more complex models like hypergraphs or multiplex/multi-relational networks. We have evaluated our work on both synthetic and real data, using several existing and new similarity measures and providing both qualitative and quantitative evidence of the new possibilities enabled by our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Detection of roles and positions in multi-layer social networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The detection of social positions and roles is one of the key tasks in the structural analysis of complex social systems. Traditionally, structural analysis methods are able to identify local and global roles and positions in networks with one or more types of relations. However, the classical way to deal with a multi-layer network consists on either (a) individually identifying positions in each layer at a time, then studying their relationships or (b) flattening the social network into a mono-relational graph and apply some of the existing blockmodeling techniques. While both previous approaches are useful to understand the structure of the social network, none of them gives us information about positions defined by the collection of individuals&#39; relations at each of the different layers and the overall structure of the multi-layer graph. The leading cause is the information lost during the post-aggregation of single-layer positions or because of the graph flattening transformation. We extend the traditional indirect approaches for blockmodeling to the analysis of social roles and positions in multi-layer networks. Our method, based on recent blockmodeling developments, substitutes the traditional relational matrices by an extended version. In the new socio-matrix the relations between two actors are substituted by relations between actors and sets of actors, resulting in two-mode data where each row represents an actor, and each column a subsetting of the network population. In second term, we substitute the node- to-node measures by multi-layer measures, as they can always be computed as function of a graph vertex actor and a set of vertices. Finally, positions are computed by clustering the rows of the extended socio-matrix, while roles are computed by comparing the distributions of their values. Differently from both traditional approaches, this new computation does not consider only the regular intra-layer information, but also the inter-layer one: all the relation types are considered together, not one at a time and not after merging them. As an example, we could identify as positions actors acting as a bridge of information between disconnected actors in a layer by simply calculating a binary measure that ``is 1 if an actor is an inter-layer bridge that connects two disconnected actors in one of the layers, and 0 otherwise&#39;&#39;. We used our framework and the new set of extended measures, to find positions and roles of interest in several multi-layer social networks representing socio-technical communities, where users communicate using different technological channels. The partitions of actors identify meaningful inter-layer positions not captured by other indirect or direct approaches. We also relate these partitions with the users that are influenced by them, that is, the columns of the extended socio-matrix. Finally, we plan to apply this new method to other social networks represented by different graph structures, like hypergraphs, where the comparison between actors and sets of actors avoids loosing information about the network structure &amp;ndash; using, for example, the hyperlinks as target sets of actors for the columns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Technical communities are social structures that emerge around the interest of individuals to build and deploy their own technology or communication infrastructure, such as wireless community networks. In these communities, the access to shared resources is regulated by incentive mechanisms, which are usually based on the members’ contributions. Typically, technical contributions are computed by these mechanisms, ignoring the non-technical activities that members voluntarily perform to keep the community alive, e.g., administration and coordination of the tasks performed by the sub-communities. This article presents a regulation mechanism that rewards not only the contribution of shared resources to the community, but also the participation of the community members in non- technical activities. This proposal was evaluated using simulations, and the obtained results allow researchers and managers of technical communities to build appropriate incentive mechanisms that rewards both, technical and non- technical contributions of their members.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Community networks are participatory connectivity solutions for citizens where all the resources are owned, managed and controlled by the participants. As a natural evolution, in recent years some initiatives have flourished to provide higher level services based on volunteer computing and resource sharing paradigms. A fundamental aspect of these paradigms is user participation. In this work, we apply some social mining techniques aiming to identify the roles of the individuals in the social network behind a community network, here Guifi.net, and to measure the participatory involvement in the community network from 2003 to 2014. We observed that community network participants generally dedicate their time and effort to a single participatory forum, generating several types of community structures. We analyzed such structures using a multiplex network formed by mailing list in Guifi.net and a relationship graph built pairwise of users that share a physical wireless link. We were able to distinguish between non-hierarchical participatory forums, where almost all users are part of the same big community and two-tier participatory forums leaded by a small number of users that act as social bridges between their members. Finally, by testing the impact of community leaders in all participatory layers, we profiled the utility of the members’ effort to the whole wireless community network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding Collaboration in Volunteer Computing Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Volunteer computing is a paradigm in which devices participating in a distributed environment share part of their resources to help others perform their activities. The effectiveness of this computing paradigm depends on the collaboration attitude adopted by the participating devices. Unfortunately for software designers it is not clear how to contribute with local resources to the shared environment without compromising resources that could then be required by the contributors. Therefore, many designers adopt a conservative position when defining the collaboration strategy to be embedded in volunteer computing applications. This position produces an underutilization of the devices’ local resources and reduces the effectiveness of these solutions. This article presents a study that helps designers understand the impact of adopting a particular collaboration attitude to contribute with local resources to the distributed shared environment. The study considers five collaboration strategies, which are analyzed in computing environments with both, abundance and scarcity of resources. The obtained results indicate that collaboration strategies based on effort-based incentives work better than those using contribution-based incentives. These results also show that the use of effort-based incentives does not jeopardize the availability of local resources for the local needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring local service allocation in Community Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Community Cloud computing is a new trend on cloud computing that aims to build service infrastructures upon Wireless Community Networks taking advantage of underused community physical resources. Service allocation protocols are a key design challenge that all cloud systems must properly address to optimize resource utilization. They are specially important when cloud services require a Quality of Service (QoS) and network stability or performance (delay, jitter, minimum bandwidth) cannot be guaranteed a-priory. This work presents a study that tries to understand how to address cloud service deployments in such scenario. In particular, we start proposing an allocation algorithm to find optimal solutions when there is a central authority that coordinates the process. These solutions optimize the communication cost in two ways: (1) minimizing the service overlay diameter and, (2) minimizing the coordination cost along the network. Based on the study of the algorithm and the experimental simulations, we study the variables that outcome optimal service allocations to the detriment of other solutions. We verify these findings using data mining techniques. Researchers can take advantage of the simulation results and our observations to design more reliable distributed algorithms able to dynamically self-adapt to network changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Community networks have emerged under the mottos of “break the strings that are limiting you”, &lt;code&gt;don&amp;amp;#x27;t buy the network, be the network&amp;amp;#x27;&amp;amp;#x27; or &lt;/code&gt;a free net for everyone is possible&#39;&#39;. Such networks create a measurable social impact as they provide to the community the right and opportunity of communication. As any other network that mixes wired and wireless links, the routing protocol must face several challenges that arise from the unreliable nature of the wireless medium. Link quality tracking helps the routing layer to select links that maximize the delivery rate and minimize traffic congestion. Moreover, link quality prediction has proved to be a technique that surpasses link quality tracking by foreseeing which links are more likely to change its quality. In this work, we focus on link quality prediction by means of a time series analysis. We apply this prediction technique in the routing layer of large-scale, distributed and decentralized networks. We demonstrate that this type of prediction achieves about a 98% of success in both the short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Community-Lab is an open, distributed infrastructure for researchers to carry out experiments within wireless community networks. Community networks are an emergent model of infrastructures built with off-the-shelf communication equipment that aims to satisfy a community&#39;s demand for Internet access and ICT services. Community-Lab consists of more than 100 nodes that are integrated in existing community networks, thus giving researchers access to community networks and allowing them to conduct experimental evaluation of routing protocols, services and applications deployed there. Community networks have now the opportunity to extend the collaborative network building to the next level, that is, building collaborative services implemented as community clouds, built, operated and maintained by the community, that run on community-owned heterogeneous resources, and offer cloud-based services that are of the community&#39;s interest. This demo paper focuses on demonstrating the cloud extension of Community-Lab, enabling now community cloud experiments. By means of selected applications, we show how Community-Lab has been extended with distributed clouds, where different devices such as server, desktop PCs, low-resource embedded PCs and IoT boards are brought together forming a heterogeneous distributed cloud environment for researchers to experiment in community networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present the community home gateway, a computer system attached to a wireless community network router, able to host platform and application services. Different to current home gateways and other low-end systems, the community home gateway offers resource virtualization, and can thus be used as a cloud resource. Furthermore, it removes the lack of a home gateway system that is open for service contributions and therefore constitutes an important step towards building P2P clouds with low-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collaborative and volunteer applications need to implement incentive mechanisms to regulate resource sharing and encourage network nodes to contribute for reaching a certain goal. Typically, these incentive mechanisms assign resources to network node requests, based on the total amount of resources contributed by the requesting participant. This approach assumes that participants contributing more should also get back more resources from the collaborative environment. This assumption turns the system unfair to those participants with scarce resources, because they have just few resources to share. This paper proposes the use of an incentive strategy based on the contribution percentage of each node; i.e. an effort-based approach. This proposal is evaluated and compared to contribution-based strategies. The obtained results show that the proposed effort-based approach not only benefits participants that have scarce resources, but also it is able to satisfy the requests of the powerful nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There currently are many mobile computing devices with various properties and capabilities. These devices may need to collaborate among them to allow nomad workers to perform a common activity. Unfortunately software developers in charge of creating infrastructures or applications allowing these devices to cooperate among them, do not count with clear guidelines to design such software components; particularly when these components must work in a scenario involving heterogeneous devices. This paper presents a study that tries to understand how to address collaboration among heterogeneous mobile devices, by exploring several variables affecting the process. In particular, this study explores various strategies to borrow CPU slots from peer mobile computing devices and return the favor back later on. The study outcomes indicate there is a short list of computing and network variables affecting the collaboration capability of the mobile devices. These findings have been verified using data mining techniques. Based on these findings and the lessons learned, the article presents a simulation method of computing scenarios that can help developers to determine which computing configuration would be suitable to be used in each particular work scenario. Software designers can take advantage of this simulation method and the design guidelines reported in this paper in order to develop applications able to work appropriately in heterogeneous computing scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a measurement study of the topology and its effect on usage of Guifi.net, a large-scale community network. It focuses on the main issues faced by community network and lessons to consider for its future growth in order to preserve its scalability, stability and openness. The results show the network topology as an atypical high density Scale-Free network with critical points of failure and poor gateway selection or placement. In addition we have found paths with a large number of hops i.e. large diameter of the graph, and specifically long paths between leaf nodes and web proxies. The usage analysis using a widespread web proxy service confirms that these topological properties have an impact on the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Advances in wireless communication systems and mobile devices allow nomad users to participate in mobile collaborative activities. However the availability of hardware resources of the mobile devices that are participating in the collaboration process is a crucial factor that can enhance or jeopardize such activity. This paper studies how the network topology and the hardware resources distributed into a network influence the collaboration among the participants in the activities. The results obtained from simulating the strategy of resource sharing in an overlay network allowed us to observe two clear implications: (1) it is important to maximize the number of links between Desktop PC and mobile devices and (2) the mobile devices have to be placed within the network topology in the nodes with higher degree. According to these observations we have proposed an heuristic for node placement in order to maximize the cooperation level in terms of resource sharing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Advances in wireless communication systems and mobile devices allow nomad users to participate in mobile collaborative activities. However the availability of hardware resources in the mobile devices participating in the collaboration process enhances or jeopardizes such activity. This paper studies how the network topology and the hardware resources distributed into a mobile network influence the collaboration activities among the participants. Several simulations were done to try to understand this issue. The obtained results show that in mobile collaboration scenarios involving a high number of resources-constraint mobile devices (e. g. handhelds), the maximum cooperation among node is obtained in a small world network topology. The results also show that another factor that encourages cooperation among nodes is the network size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lack of computational resources on personal computers, in addition to evident increasingly of requirements in the current software, needs a imperative redefinition of computing paradigms that existed until now. The distributed computing networks are the currently solutions that are being evaluated to solve the problem with the lack of hardware resources. However, the implementation of these solutions is stopped by the lack of knowledge about its functioning and the need to resolve technological problems that research and innovation have not yet discovered how. One of the unresolved problems is how to generate sufficient trust among users in order to ensure a certain level of cooperation inside the network, or what is the same: how to generate a two-way collaboration. This master thesis seeks to explore various mechanisms based on incentives and topologies to promote cooperation using a simulator as a tool capable of evaluating cooperation indicators over multiple network topologies, applications and strategies on distributed systems as a grids. Therefore, the first part focuses on the study of cooperation and identify which parameters are wearing out, and which do not influence. The second objective is create a tool as powerful and modular enough to extract sufficient conclusions before use it on different scenarios and, finally, the last part is focused on analyzing results and creating a verifiable negotiation protocol for sharing resources in distributed networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

El rendiment actual d’aquesta part de recepció és força baix, de forma que es fa impossible la visualització de fluxos més grans de 600 Mbps. En aquest treball es detallen els resultats de l’estudi del software de visualització distribuïda SAGE i es descriu el procés d’implementació d’un nou mòdul de transmissió que utilitza el protocol de transport UDP. Tot i que l’estudi no s’ha endinsat en el tractament gràfic de l’aplicació, ha permès entendre el funcionament intern de l’aplicació i crear un model de plans i mòduls vàlid. Durant el procés de desenvolupament, s’han implementat quatre versions diferents del mòdul, utilitzant diferents estratègies i s’ha fet un estudi comparatiu amb el mòdul TCP que ja existia. Els resultats mostren que les versions amb UDP permeten enviar, com a mínim, fluxos de fins a 1’5 Gbps; suficients com per transmetre vídeos d’Alta Definició a través de la plataforma V3; no obstant que la visualització correcta de les imatges al sistema de pantalles es troba restringida a unes condicions concretes. Finalment, es proposen una sèrie d’estratègies a curt i llarg termini per acabar la implementació del mòdul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
