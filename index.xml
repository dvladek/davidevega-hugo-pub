      <description>Social media are a key source of information for society, but it has been proven that can be also an effective source of misinformation if the readers are not critical or knowledgable enough. The goal of this project is to make a randomized controlled experiment to test if and how much sustainability experts can be manipulated.
The first part of the project consists on exploring what type of platforms we can use to run experiments like the one described below.</description>

      <description>This is a co-taught with the other members of the InfoLab Matteo Magnani and Christian Rohner .
Network Science is a very active and interdisciplinary research area aimed at studying physical, social and biological systems that can be modeled as sets of interconnected entities. The course covers the basics of network science, including social network analysis centrality measures (degree, betweenness, &amp;hellip;), network properties (degree distribution, average path length, &amp;hellip;), network models (Erdös- Renyi, small-world, preferential attachment), propagation (SI/SIR/SIS models, &amp;hellip;), and the main network mining tasks (position/role detection, link prediction, community detection).</description>

      <description>The objective of this course is to give both (i) basic and some advanced theoretical knowledge and (ii) practical skills in software engineering and project management. In short, in this course we will take a practical perspective, but the course also includes a fair amount of theoretical concepts and ideas. The course is structured around lectures, activities and a project.
The lectures and activities give training about all the theoretical aspects related with specifying, managing and maintaining large scale and complex software projects; emphasizing agile approaches over others.</description>

      <description>Human-generated information underlies nearly every aspect of our lives. With the rise of affordable handheld and embedded IoT devices with new connectivity capabilities and the ever-increasing integration of many technologies with social media platforms, most social problem-solving processes are increasingly relying on online conversations and textual communication. However, unlike in a face-to-face situation, where we can fairly recognise which conversations are co-occurring around us and their participants, automatically identifying cohesive conversations online is a challenging task.</description>

      <description>Software development is an area in which companies not only need to keep up with the latest technology, but they additionally need to continuously increase their productivity to stay competitive in the industry. One company currently facing these challenges is Storytel - one of the strongest players on the Swedish audiobook market - with about a fourth of all employees involved with software development, and a rapidly growing workforce.
With the purpose of understanding how the Storytel Tech Department is performing, this thesis maps Storytel’s productivity defined through the Four Key Metrics - Deployment Frequency, Delivery Lead Time, Mean Time To Restore and Change Fail Rate.</description>

      <description>Newspapers might report on the same event, say a sport event or a political statement, but since they most likely differ in the presentation, are the content and under laying message of the articles actually the same? A human can read two separate articles and determine if they touch similar subjects and if they approach the subject in a positive or negative way. If this comparison would be preformed over several thousand of articles a computer would very much be the preferred method.</description>

      <description>Multilayer networks have been widely used to represent and analyze systems of interconnected entities where both the entities and their connections can be of different types. However, real multilayer networks can be difficult to analyze because of irrelevant information, such as layers not related to the objective of the analysis, because of their size, or because traditional methods defined to analyze simple networks do not have a straightforward extension able to handle multiple layers.</description>

      <description>In text mining, texts are usually transformed into numerical vectors or feature vectors, before they are given to a machine learning algorithm for text classification. In this project, a set of features for classifying tweets in Swedish was created. The following classification tasks were selected: gender, age and political party prediction, sentiment analysis and authorship attribution, which is the task of determining if a text was written by a particular author or not.</description>

      <description>Human communication, either online or offline, is characterized by when information is shared from one actor to the other and by what specific information is exchanged. Using text as a way to represent the exchanged information, we can represent human communication systems with a temporal text network model where actors and messages coexist in a dynamic multilayer network. In this model, actors and messages are represented in separate layers, connected by inter-layer temporal edges representing the communication acts—who and when communicate what information.</description>

      <description>This paper proposes to use MeetUp data to study the emergence and the evolution of the technological trend commonly known as Internet of Things (IoT). Starting from a manually selected sample of 220 European MeetUp groups we used MeetUp&#39;s APIs, to retrieve additional information about the events and participating users. The final dataset consists of 220 groups, 32967 members and 2386 events from 2011 until now (Jan 2019). The results suggest the presence of clearly identifiable European hubs for IoT development but a worldwide crowd of users.</description>

      <description>Pattern detection in social networks has been of great interest recently because it helps to reveal insights about how people communicate. In graph mining, this is referred to as a frequent sub-graphs mining problem and it has many variations regarding the structure of the network - i.e. how much information the graph holds. As a part of the evolution of the problem, additional information such as data dimensions or more advanced network structure are incorporated to the input to find more interesting hidden patterns.</description>

      <description>The widespread social media usage generates an immense amount of data. Data which is highly beneficial to several domains whether monetary or research based. Various models exist to extract this data however analysis tend to be restrictive. The temporal text network model is a dynamic network model built upon the foundation of temporal networks. It provides text as a variable and considers messages passed between users while maintaining the time of transmission, making it suitable for social media analysis.</description>

      <title>From interaction to participation: the role of the imagined audience in social media community detection and an application to political communication on Twitter</title>

      <description>In the context of community detection in online social media, a lot of effort has been put into the definition of sophisticated network clustering algorithms and much less on the equally crucial process of obtaining high-quality input data. User-interaction data explicitly provided by social media platforms has largely been used as the main source of data because of its easy accessibility. However, this data does not capture a fundamental and much more frequent type of participatory behavior where users do not explicitly mention others but direct their messages to an invisible audience following a common hashtag.</description>

      <description>Three fundamental elements to understand human information networks are the individuals (actors) in the network, the information they exchange, that is often observable online as text content (emails, social media posts, etc.), and the time when these exchanges happen. An extremely large amount of research has addressed some of these aspects either in isolation or as combinations of two of them. There are also more and more works studying systems where all three elements are present, but typically using ad hoc models and algorithms that cannot be easily transferred to other contexts.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years online social media have been frequently used as a way to explain human social behavior around a particular area of interest. Examples include voting, political sentiment, psychological well-being and disaster response. The public accessibility of several sources allows us to observe these phenomena at various scales, from conversations among small groups of individuals to the effects on large communities. To cope with the complexity of online information, researchers have typically focused on either the topology of the interactions, as commonly done in Network Science, or the text exchanged among individuals, using methods from Computational Linguistics.</description>

      <description>A large amount of human generated information is available online in the form of text exchanged between individuals or groups. Examples include social network sites, on- line forums and emails.

      <description>The content of Online Illicit Marketplaces (OIMs) on the Dark Web has been studied using different approaches. For example, qualitative ethnographic studies to understand the markets&#39; social dynamics have produced interesting descriptions of specific sites, contexts and behaviours [1]; but given the large amount of data exchanged on several markets a manual qualitative analysis can only provide a partial view of these systems. Therefore, more quantitative approaches have been used (e.</description>

      <description>Cloud services in community networks have been enabled by micro-cloud providers. They form community network micro-clouds (CNMCs), which grow organically, i.e. without being planned and optimized beforehand. Services running in community networks face specific challenges intrinsic to these infrastructures, such as the limited capacity of nodes and links, their dynamics and geographic distribution. CNMCs are used to deploy distributed applications, such as streaming and storage services, which transfer significant amounts of data between the nodes on which they run.</description>

      <description>We rethink and extend the concepts of position and role in a network, basing them on various well-known measures that were not previously associated with these concepts, such as geodesic distance and modularity. The effectiveness of our new role and position detection algorithms is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, on synthetic and real data, showing that we can identify new types of meaningful patterns in networks.</description>

      <description>Collaborative learning activities have shown to be useful to address educational processes in several contexts. Monitoring these activities is mandatory to determine the quality of the collaboration and learning processes. Recent research works propose using Social Network Analysis techniques to understand students’ collaboration learning process during these experiences. Aligned with that, this paper proposes the use of the indirect blockmodeling network analytic technique for monitoring the behaviour of different social roles played by students in collaborative learning scenarios.</description>

      <description>Contributory and volunteer computing ecosystems built around a community of participants need, like any other common-pool resources, an adaptive governance mechanism to guarantee the sustainability of the ecosystem. Reciprocity incentive mechanisms based on economic principles have been proved efficient solutions to regulate the resource sharing and allocation in large computing architectures, guaranteeing a direct retribution for each individual contribution even in presence of misbehaving users. However, while these mechanisms preserve the macro-equilibrium of the computational shared resources (e.</description>

      <description>Community networks have emerged under the mottos “break the strings that are limiting you”, “don&#39;t buy the network, be the network” or “a free net for everyone is possible”. Such networks create a measurable social impact as they provide to the community the right and opportunity of communication. As any other network that mixes wired and wireless links, the routing protocol must face several challenges that arise from the unreliable nature of the wireless medium.</description>

      <description>Roles and positions are structural components in complex social systems which group actors based on how similarly they are connected to the rest of the actors. Role and position detection methods have been successfully used to evaluate and understand the dynamics of social networks and the behavior of their members. However, actor similarities used to detect positions have been based on pairwise comparisons so far: e.g., structural equivalence states that Alice and Bob are in the same position if they are both connected or not to the same other actors in the network, one by one.</description>

      <description>The detection of social positions and roles is one of the key tasks in the structural analysis of complex social systems. Traditionally, structural analysis methods are able to identify local and global roles and positions in networks with one or more types of relations. However, the classical way to deal with a multi-layer network consists on either (a) individually identifying positions in each layer at a time, then studying their relationships or (b) flattening the social network into a mono-relational graph and apply some of the existing blockmodeling techniques.</description>

      <description>Technical communities are social structures that emerge around the interest of individuals to build and deploy their own technology or communication infrastructure, such as wireless community networks. In these communities, the access to shared resources is regulated by incentive mechanisms, which are usually based on the members’ contributions. Typically, technical contributions are computed by these mechanisms, ignoring the non-technical activities that members voluntarily perform to keep the community alive, e.g., administration and coordination of the tasks performed by the sub-communities.</description>

      <description>Community networks are participatory connectivity solutions for citizens where all the resources are owned, managed and controlled by the participants. As a natural evolution, in recent years some initiatives have flourished to provide higher level services based on volunteer computing and resource sharing paradigms. A fundamental aspect of these paradigms is user participation. In this work, we apply some social mining techniques aiming to identify the roles of the individuals in the social network behind a community network, here Guifi.</description>

      <description>Volunteer computing is a paradigm in which devices participating in a distributed environment share part of their resources to help others perform their activities. The effectiveness of this computing paradigm depends on the collaboration attitude adopted by the participating devices. Unfortunately for software designers it is not clear how to contribute with local resources to the shared environment without compromising resources that could then be required by the contributors. Therefore, many designers adopt a conservative position when defining the collaboration strategy to be embedded in volunteer computing applications.</description>

Service allocation protocols are a key design challenge that all cloud systems must properly address to optimize resource utilization. They are specially important when cloud services require a Quality of Service (QoS) and network stability or performance (delay, jitter, minimum bandwidth) cannot be guaranteed a-priory.</description>

      <description>We present the community home gateway, a computer system attached to a wireless community network router, able to host platform and application services. Different to current home gateways and other low-end systems, the community home gateway offers resource virtualization, and can thus be used as a cloud resource. Furthermore, it removes the lack of a home gateway system that is open for service contributions and therefore constitutes an important step towards building P2P clouds with low-end devices.</description>

      <description>Collaborative and volunteer applications need to implement incentive mechanisms to regulate resource sharing and encourage network nodes to contribute for reaching a certain goal. Typically, these incentive mechanisms assign resources to network node requests, based on the total amount of resources contributed by the requesting participant. This approach assumes that participants contributing more should also get back more resources from the collaborative environment. This assumption turns the system unfair to those participants with scarce resources, because they have just few resources to share.</description>

      <description>There currently are many mobile computing devices with various properties and capabilities. These devices may need to collaborate among them to allow nomad workers to perform a common activity. Unfortunately software developers in charge of creating infrastructures or applications allowing these devices to cooperate among them, do not count with clear guidelines to design such software components; particularly when these components must work in a scenario involving heterogeneous devices. This paper presents a study that tries to understand how to address collaboration among heterogeneous mobile devices, by exploring several variables affecting the process.</description>

      <description>Advances in wireless communication systems and mobile devices allow nomad users to participate in mobile collaborative activities. However the availability of hardware resources of the mobile devices that are participating in the collaboration process is a crucial factor that can enhance or jeopardize such activity. This paper studies how the network topology and the hardware resources distributed into a network influence the collaboration among the participants in the activities. The results obtained from simulating the strategy of resource sharing in an overlay network allowed us to observe two clear implications: (1) it is important to maximize the number of links between Desktop PC and mobile devices and (2) the mobile devices have to be placed within the network topology in the nodes with higher degree.</description>

      <description>Advances in wireless communication systems and mobile devices allow nomad users to participate in mobile collaborative activities. However the availability of hardware resources in the mobile devices participating in the collaboration process enhances or jeopardizes such activity. This paper studies how the network topology and the hardware resources distributed into a mobile network influence the collaboration activities among the participants. Several simulations were done to try to understand this issue. The obtained results show that in mobile collaboration scenarios involving a high number of resources-constraint mobile devices (e.</description>

      <description>The lack of computational resources on personal computers, in addition to evident increasingly of requirements in the current software, needs a imperative redefinition of computing paradigms that existed until now. The distributed computing networks are the currently solutions that are being evaluated to solve the problem with the lack of hardware resources. However, the implementation of these solutions is stopped by the lack of knowledge about its functioning and the need to resolve technological problems that research and innovation have not yet discovered how.</description>

      <description>La fundació i2CAT, dins del projecte de recerca V3 (Video, Videoconferència i Visualització en HD), treballa actualment en una solució de videoconferència en Alta Definició que utilitza el software SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) per visualitzar la informació que es rep en una graella de pantalles de 1200 per 1600 píxels. El rendiment actual d’aquesta part de recepció és força baix, de forma que es fa impossible la visualització de fluxos més grans de 600 Mbps.</description>
